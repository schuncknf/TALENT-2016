# specify the type of NN interaction, here you can use Idaho-A,

# important point concerning the different interaction models Idaho-A
# and Idaho-B have NO charge-symmetry (CSB) or charge-independence
# breaking terms (ISB).  The Argonne potentials run only with full CSB
# and CIB.  The N3LO and CD-bonn models allow you to run with or
# without one or both of these terms.  NO CSB means that for a given
# set of qauntum numbers ( a specific partial wave) the
# neutron-neutron and proton-proton parts are identical NO CIB means
# that the proton-proton, neutron-neutron and proton-neutron
# interactions are equal. Isospin symmetry.  You can also use the
# following options, which give you the bare interaction only: OPEP
# (one-pion exchange from Argonne v18), LSinteraction, only two-body
# spin-orbit from Argonne V8 and Tensorinteraction, only tensor part
# from Argonne V8.

# infinite integration limit set it to 20 fm^-1.  Recall that the NN
# interactions is fitted up to 350 MeV.  If you do v-krg, then
# k_cutoff is your RG point, typically 2-3 fm^-1.  Your total number
# of integration points are n=n_k1+n_k2.  For Effective field
# interactions use k_max approximately 6-8 fm^-1.  For standard OBE
